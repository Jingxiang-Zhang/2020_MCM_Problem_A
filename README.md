This competition is Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) in 2020, problem A, predict how the fish will move toward by the influential of ocean temperature growth. As a part of a team, my job was to complete all of relative program of this problem. I use Python as a programming language.

Because of the global warming, the ocean temperature will keep growthing. In the same time, the fish living in the ocean around England will go north to find the optimum temperature. As a result, fisher will need to spend more on catching the fish. And our job was to figure out the whole process.
